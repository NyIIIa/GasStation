# Overview

The GasStation application is designed to assist with fuel calculations at gas stations. Given the daily consumption and arrival of various types of fuel, the application's primary aim is to automate the process of recording fuel consumption, arrivals, and transactions through the creation of an IC automation system.

# Service Architecture
